Hey,

Thank you for using my pack!

In order to use this, you will have to navigate to your Dead by Daylight folder.

- Right click on Dead by Daylight in Steam
- Properties 
- Go to local files
- Click on ''browse local files''
- Go to DeadByDaylight

And then you can copy pasta the pack files into the Dead by Daylight folder and replace everything. 

Enjoy!
